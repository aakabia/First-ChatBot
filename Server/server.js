// .* is the first arg that tells the bot to listen to all messages.
// The second argument, "message", specifies the type of event to listen
// The third argument is an asynchronous function that defines how the bot should respond.
// The bot object that provides methods for interacting with the user (like replying to messages).
// message is need as first arg in bot.reply for meta data about the message the bot needs.
// The message object that contains information about the incoming message, including the text the user sent.
// Last,  we await the reply with bot.reply
