// newMessage creates a new message object with three properties.
// newMessage represents the context of the message or the user interaction thats why it is passed as first param in bot.reply
// await controller.adapter.bot.reply  uses Botkit's reply method to generate a response based on the new message object. 
// The response is crafted to indicate that the bot heard the message.
// socket.emit sends a message back to the client through the WebSocket connection. 
// The event "chat response" is emitted along with a string that acknowledges the received message.
